title: "Workshop: utopias and dystopias of free software"
---  


The workshop consisted in making different exercises to get in a collaborative way some narratives about the future in relation to digital technologies.
One of the objetives of the workshop was to realize how the collective imaginary is being building nowdays and the role and influence of digital technologies have in the process, to be aware of our fears, alienation and how utopia-dystopia are two sides of the same coin. Another objetive was to get some a ideas for a plot that could be used in a future audiovisual job. 
 
We thank all participants and  Libre Graphic Meeting  to have given us the oportunity to work in such especial event.

The video shows some mixed fragments of the stories we imagined
