<p>
FLOSS, Free Libre Open Source Software means that you can use, copy, share, modify, redistribute and allow free access to the source code of the programs without restrictions.
</p>
<p>
The use of this software has social and philosophical implications in art, building a kind of cultural ecosystem which emphasizes collaborative practice and freedom.
</p>

<p>The cultural ecosystem based in FLOSS philosophy consists in a processual approach to the concept of artwork in which roles are reevaluated. From people involved in the development of a tool to those working in the final visual results are considered  as parts of a same long process that involve the entire community.
</p>

<strong>Objectives</strong>
<p>
To join people and collectives interested to explore free culture concepts and FLOSS tools for audiovisual work as alternatives to mainly used privative programs; artist, programmers and people in general. 
</p>
<p>
To make communities and projects visible.
</p>
<p>
To promote a meeting space that will allow participants to put in common our knowledge, needs, problems, expectations and experiences around this cultural ecosystem that joins art, culture and activism, focusing in the need to collaboration between different disciplines.
</p>
<p>
To test different free software tools for audiovisual
