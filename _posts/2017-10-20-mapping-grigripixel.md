During the residence in Madrid of the artist and programmer Bay Dam on the occasion of the Grigri pixel 2017, AVfloss has collaborated in the workshop and the production of a video mapping performance in EVA Arganzuela, the old fruit market of Legazpi.
</p>

<p>
This project is the collaborative work of the participants in the workshop "video mapping with MAPMAP" that Bai Dam did the week before the performance.
</p>
<p>
Subsequently, a Hackathon was held for the development of the free software program MAPMAP.
